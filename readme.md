# Dotfiles
My configuration files & a script for soft linking them where they should be.

# TODO
- [ ] `git diff --no-index X Y` for collisions with [y/n] prompt
- [ ] which /etc/* files to include?

# Emacs TODO:
- [ ] Prevent Esc from killing Python REPL
- [ ] There's like 3 different ways of opening REPLs, each with different
      behaviour, find one that works with the above
- [ ] Backwards kill-(word/_sentence_) sucks
- [ ] :q for killing workspace? :qa for killing everything?
- [ ] Decrement/increment like in VIM C-A/C-X
- [ ] VSCode like shortcuts
